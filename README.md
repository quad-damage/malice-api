# malice-api
Unofficial LUA api for Malice

## MKDocs
Please install MKDocs (follow [this](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/installation/) guide) and then do ``mkdocs serve`` in the malice-api folder.

You will be able to see a local version of the wiki at ``127.0.0.1:8000``

There are a lot of things that are undocumented. Please check out the raw dump, cross reference with the current api and write new entries.
